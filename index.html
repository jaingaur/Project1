            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Pandemics have occurred throughout history and appear to be increasing in frequency, particularly because of the increasing emergence of viral disease from animals.
                Pandemic risk is driven by the combined effects of spark risk (where a pandemic is likely to arise) and spread risk (how likely it is to diffuse broadly through human populations).
                Some geographic regions with high spark risk, including Central and West Africa, lag behind the rest of the globe in pandemic preparedness.
                Probabilistic modeling and analytical tools such as exceedance probability (EP) curves are valuable for assessing pandemic risk and estimating the potential burden of pandemics.
                Influenza is the most likely pathogen to cause a severe pandemic. EP analysis indicates that in any given year, a 1 percent probability exists of an influenza pandemic that causes nearly 6 million pneumonia and influenza deaths or more globally.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The pandemic may open the way to either major reform or meaningful incremental changes. These could include:

                Building on and fully enforcing the ACA, including having the federal government cover the full costs of expanding Medicaid eligibility and enhancing subsidies for marketplace coverage.
                Moving toward alternative payment models like capitation to help ensure a predictable stream of revenue to providers that isn’t linked to the volume of services delivered.
                Addressing inequities in health care by continuing to expand access to coverage, supporting safety-net facilities and small community providers, and requiring that health professionals attend antibias training.
                Improving our public health response by rigorously testing, contact-tracing, and isolating infected people.
                Passing federal legislation that would: establish a national public health information system with real-time data on disease prevalence; expand federal funding for developing and distributing new diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines; require states to adopt measures to contain the spread of infection; and allow licensed health professionals to participate in cross-state telemedicine.</p>

I also wanted to give back to the community of East Lubbock, which is predominately people of color. There aren't a lot of resources or support for artists of color. I started applying for grants in the beginning of the pandemic, and used the money to make art kits for children to encourage them to create in different mediums. They get a canvas and watercolors, art supplies I wish I had when I was a kid. When I first told people about this, they asked me: What if you don't get the money for it? I said I will just keep working on it.<br>

But now it has become the only way we can connect with each other. Before I worked with local women to help them process their grief by telling their stories, but now I reach women even farther away through the virtual world. My work has been super heavy during the pandemic because there has been so much collective grieving. It's sad and lonely. I call my grandma for help. She was eight months pregnant with my mother when she crossed the border into this country through the Rio Grande River, while carrying my uncle in a washtub. She never had the space to grieve. When I was sad, she always said to me in a stern voice: "No estas pendeja! Andale, muevete! You're not stupid! Let's go, get moving!" I remember her resilience, and honor her grief because she didn't get to.<br>

I tell them to get really, really basic. There are ways of authentically coming together in smaller groups on virtual platforms to talk about a book we have all read. That's a social opportunity and our kids are very lonely. The opportunity here is that we as a society have been forced to pause. That pause could actually get the students to do the things that are most beneficial: reading, writing, reflecting, journaling, doodling, scribbling, writing slivers of poems, thinking deep thoughts, expressing sadness, expressing joy. I hope we don't squander this moment to reset from our flat-screen environments. We should be putting books in the hands of our children.<br>
